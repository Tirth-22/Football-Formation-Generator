# Football Formation Generator

## Description
The **Football Formation Generator** is a Java console-based tool that helps coaches, players, and football enthusiasts determine optimal formations based on their teamâ€™s player positions and match type.  
Users can input players with their positions, select the type of match (**Group Stage**, **Knock-out**, or **Final**), and instantly get recommended formations suited to their squad.  

The project follows a clean **MVC-style package structure**:
- `app` â†’ Main entry point and user interaction.
- `model` â†’ Player-related data models.
- `service` â†’ Formation recommendation logic.
